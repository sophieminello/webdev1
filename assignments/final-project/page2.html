        <p>Wow, what an awesome day in the orchard. Here, you’ll see our baskets of some of the freshest and the best music and art content. We are here to create a cozy environment where we can spin all our favorite records while admiring the artwork and greenery around us…

        Created in 2017, Sunlight Magazine was a high school passion project for Sophie Minello. Through Sunlight, she aimed to give both musicians and artists a platform to share any sort of content they felt passionate about. Since then, it has evolved beyond simply music, encapsulating a plethora of different topics. It has also expanded past the website format, printing 5 physical issues bi-yearly. Like all of us, Sunlight has gone through big changes since it’s birth, and it will always continue to grow. 
            
        Thank you for choosing to grow with us. 
            
        XOXO - Sunlight Team</p>
