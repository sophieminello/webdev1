        <p>Created in 2017, Sunlight Magazine was a high school passion project for Sophie Minello. Through Sunlight, she aimed to give both musicians and artists a platform to share any sort of content they felt passionate about. Since then, it has evolved beyond simply music, encapsulating a plethora of different topics. It has also expanded past the website format, printing 5 physical issues bi-yearly. Like all of us, Sunlight has gone through big changes since itâ€™s birth, and it will always continue to grow. 
            
        Thank you for choosing to grow with us.</p>
